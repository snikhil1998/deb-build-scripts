This repository has bash scripts to automate building Debian packages from source codes of GitHub repositories. Scripts are made only for the github repositories which do not have the Debian packages.

Currently, only scripts for building NoteBook Fan Control (NBFC) and RyzenAdj are made.

# Usage

- Install any necessary packages as suggested in the README of the repository.
- When a repository is cloned, put the corresponding bash script in the cloned repository and run the script. Incase the package should be built but not installed, comment the last line.
